Sand Simulation following Simple rules (2D)
This is my first Project in C++ and I feel like it turned out fairly well allthough the code is not pretty at all :)

If you want to build it type the following commands in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/the-lightstack/sandSimulation
cd sandSimulation
make install
./sandAnimation
```
